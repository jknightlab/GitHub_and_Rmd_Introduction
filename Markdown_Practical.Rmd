In the Git practical, we used markdown for the README file. Here is a quick 
refresher, with a few extras: 
```
**bold** and _italic_ (or *italic*)

# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

Unordered List:
* Item 1
* Item 2

Ordered List:
1 Item 1
2 Item 2

A [linked phrase](http://example.com)

A quote:

Oscar Wilde said:

> Be yourself; everybody else
> is already taken.

and a^[footnote]

A horizontal rule:

***********

or 

---------

sub~scripts~

`r ''`
```

You can already see that it is useful to make simple text documents look much
better. The actual markdown document is very readable and easy to edit, and R
Studio has spell check and find/replace.) However, there are other benefits to
using Markdown. 

## Why not just use Word?

### Images and tables

1. Open R Studio again and add the following to your README file:

```
![](https://ipetcompanion.com/feedapuppy/styles/media/puppy.jpg)
```
Have you ever tried to format images in Word, and make them all stay where you
want to? We are currently working with a pretty simple document, but once you
are over a couple of pages, markdown makes this much more straightforwad. The 
rule is that you have the ! and square brackets, then the path to your image goes
in the normal brackets. This can be a local file, e.g.

```
![](my_image.jpg)
```

2. In the drop down menu next to the Preview button, click Preview in Word, or 
pdf. Then look at the different outputs you can get (I think the PDF will only
work if you have a LaTeX distribution installed). Web pages and PDFs look
nice, right? But html and LaTeX are too complicated to learn just for a short
document. Well, markdown is a simpler alternative. As well as looking nice on
GitHub, you can email the file generated and email it to someone (e.g. Julian).
You can imagine that this is a nice way of sharing a summary of what you have been working on. 

3. You can include a clickable table of contents. Click the settings button and
check the table of contents box. Preview the file, and you will see that you can
click on the entries to move to that part of the file. 

4. Let's include a table. Add the following to your file and preview:

```
  Right     Left     Center     Default
-------     ------ ----------   -------
     12     12        12            12
    123     123       123          123
      1     1          1             1

Table:  Demonstration of simple table syntax.
```

OK, that table is annoying to type out. Try going to 
http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables and copying in a more 
complicated table from Excel, then copying the markdown output back. Much better.
You can also format these tables differently (see
[here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html))

### R Markdown

The main reason I use Markdown though is R Markdown. This allows you to include
chunks of R (or other languages) code in your document, which are then executed
and the output included in your html file. To try this out, open a new R Markdown
file in R Studio. Give it a title, and the template will be opened. Click "Knit"
(Knit is the R package used to convert Markdown into html), and you will be asked
to save it first. Put it in your Git repository for now. 

1. First, you can see that your title, name, and the date have been put in at the
top. Looking at the R Markdown file, you will see a section at the top surrounded
by - - -

```
---
title: "Markdown Practical"
author: "Katie Burnham"
date: "7 February 2017"
output: html_document
---
```

This is called the yaml header (yaml stands for either "yet another markup
language" or "YAML ain't markup language"). This contains the information the
programme needs to generate your file. In our README.md file, this just says that
the output is an html document. However, we can extend this. For example, open
the output options from the settings menu and add a table of contents, change the
default figure size, and number section headings. Knit the file again to see the 
difference. 

You can of course edit the yaml section directly, rather than going
through the settings menu. For example, at the moment, the date is written out.
However, we don't want to have to retype it every time we edit the file. Instead,
replace it with

```{r include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
'`r Sys.Date()`'
```

This is R code, meaning "print out today's date". We will come back to using R in
the next section. First, here are a few other options you can add:

```
title: "Markdown Practical"
author:
  name: Katie Burnham
  affiliation: WTCHG
date: "7 February 2017"
output: 
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float:
      collapsed: true
      smooth_scroll: false
    theme: flatly
    highlight: kate
    code_folding: hide
```

When an R Markdown file is processed to make the HTML file, there is an 
intermediate markdown file made and not kept. I like to keep the markdown file,
because I can then upload both the Rmd and md files to GitHub, and have the
markdown file displayed as HTML there with no extra work. To do this, include:
```
html_document:
  keep_md: true
```

If you knit to a pdf, you can also keep the LaTeX file generated.

### Some R Code Chunks

The R Markdown template contains some example code chunks. The first one is:

    ```{r setup, include=FALSE}`r ''`
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
    ```

Code chunks are indicated using three ticks. After the opening ticks, you tell it
what sort of code you are using, so ` {r} ` or ` {bash} ` or ` {python} `. For
now, we will use R as it is more likely to work straight off. The next word is 
the name of your chunk. This allows easy navigation and bug finding. Go back to
your R markdown file, and you will see your code chunks are listed in the 
document outline. You can also navigate to them using the menu at the bottom of 
the editor panel. 

I always have a setup chunk first, in which I set the options for the rest of the
document. It will look like this:

    ```{r set-up, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}`r ''`
    library(ggplot2) # load any packages here
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = TRUE, message = FALSE,	warning = FALSE)
    ```
This means that I want my code to be evaluated, but I don't want any messages
or warnings from R to be printed out. 

You can then include actual code in subsequent chunks. The template document
uses the example dataset cars to show how R Markdown can print out tables (using
summary) and plots (using plot). 

1. The table is ugly. Change the start of this chunk to 
`{r cars, results="asis"}` and the contents to `knitr::kable(summary(cars))`

To add in new chunks, there is a button called
"Insert" as a shortcut, and in each chunk there is a little settings button 
where you can modify the defaults. You can then run this code like normal R code,
you can run each chunk individually, you can run all the chunks together (see
the drop down menu next to "Run""), or you can knit the document and they are
run and the output included. In our YAML header, we have told it to hide the 
code, but you can also display it by changing this. 

### Caching

Your code might take a long time to run. You can add the following to your setup
to save the output of each chunk so that they don't have to be regenerated
unless you have edited that chunk:

```
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
```

### Using R Markdown on galahad/rescomp

I work locally as much as I can, because I can then try out little bits of code,
knit, add a bit of text, knit, and so on. However, if you are working with large
datasets, the way to knit R Markdown documents is using the `knitr` package and 
the `knit` command. I've put an R Markdown document in /well/jknight if you want 
to try this:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd /well/jknight

R
install.packages(knitr)
library(knitr)

knit("RMarkdown_practical.Rmd")
```

The html file will be generated in the current directory
